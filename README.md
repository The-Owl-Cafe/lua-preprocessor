# NOTICE: Slow updates, no support will be provided, this project is likely to be phased out of use in support of migrating gamemode logic away from lua over time for most owl cafe gamemodes. Remaining lua code will focus on manual optimizations going forward

# lua-preprocessor
A preprocessor designed to apply optimizations to code before it gets included. This will allow code to be written cleanly without having to lose optimizations that would otherwise make code difficult to support
